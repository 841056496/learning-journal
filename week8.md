Week 8 - Learning Experiments
1. Introduction
This week's assignment requires me to do a "small experiment" on learning methods. I decided to experiment with the effects of "learning in segments vs. learning for a long time at once" on my memory and comprehension. The following are the specific steps and results of the experiment I conducted this week.

2. Hypothesis (Hypothesis)
Hypothesis: "Breaking an hour of study into two 30-minute concentrated study sessions with a five-minute break in between will improve memory and comprehension more effectively than studying for an hour straight at once."

Why do you think so?

I found that after an hour of continuous study, my concentration is easy to decline, and my efficiency will become very low in the second half.

Some studies have suggested that "Pomodoro" or "Pomodoro" style of learning can reduce fatigue and improve concentration.

So my guess is that "learning in segments" will help me remember more key points when I review the material and make fewer mistakes when I continue the assignment later.

3. Method of experiment
3.1 Experimental subjects/contents
Choose two readings of similar difficulty (two different sections of the same chapter in the course) two readings of about 15 pages each.

I studied them at different times to compare the results.

3.2 Test Form
Short test: For each material, I write 10 short answer questions on the day after learning, and spend 10 minutes on the next day answering them to see how much I can recall and understand.

Homework error rate: I also recorded the number of mistakes or jams in this part of the knowledge when completing the homework.

3.3 Groups and Processes
Day 1 (One-time Learning Group)

From 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., study "Material A" (15 pages) continuously.

Do not do anything else in the middle, do not leave your seat, read and take simple notes in one go.

Make 10 self-test questions later in the day, but do not test immediately, save for the next day.

Day 2 (Segmented Learning Group)

From 3:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., study "Material B" (15 pages) with high concentration and brief notes.

3:30-3:35, take a 5 minute break (get up and walk around, drink water, relax).

At 3:35-4:05, study the rest of the section (the second half of material B) again, taking notes with high concentration.

Later in the day, 10 self-tests were also made for material B.

Day 3 (Review + Test)

At the same time (such as 10:00 AM), do the 10 questions of "Material A" first, and then do the 10 questions of "Material B".

Record how many answers each group got right, how long it took, and whether you hesitated or couldn't remember.

When completing the relevant homework in the afternoon, count the "number of errors" or "stuck points" on this part of the knowledge.

4. Results of the experiment
4.1 Test Score
Material A (one time learning) : 7 out of 10 questions were correct, 2 were unable to recall key concepts, and 1 was confused.

Duration: About 8 minutes

Self-feeling: Some of the content is unclear, especially the latter part is fuzzy.

Material B (learning in sections) : 9 out of 10 questions were correct, and only 1 missed the point.

Duration: about 6 minutes

Self-perception: Clear thinking, more smooth recall.

4.2 Operation error rate/number of shell jams
Material A: When writing the knowledge points related to the homework, there were three mistakes or jams, and I need to go back to my notes.

Material B: Only once stuck, the whole is more convenient.

5. Analysis & Discussion
According to the results, the segmented study (Material B) did make me perform better on the test the next day, with an accuracy rate of 90% > 70% and answering faster. Fewer errors when completing a job.
I suspect the reason is:

Focus: Studying for 30 minutes gives me a sense of urgency without getting tired or distracted in the second half hour.

Taking short breaks relaxes the brain so that the second half of the day is still productive.

Or maybe I was more concerned about the "new way", so I was particularly serious. But it also goes to show that splitting time in moderation can really help.

6. Insight (What you learned this week)
Self-learning strategy: Segmented learning makes the overall efficiency higher, and I obviously remember it better than I used to push through an hour in one sitting. In the future, it can be flexibly applied, such as the "Pomodoro method" of 25 to 30 minutes of concentration and 5 minutes of rest.

The scientific method is very practical: in the past, I just said by feeling "like this is good to learn", but now through specific experimental comparison and test results, I can judge more objectively.

Limitations:

Only two days of testing, the sample is too small, and there may be slight differences in the state of the day and the difficulty of the material.

Consider diversifying the questions next time, or extending the test period for further confirmation.

Plan: I hope to try this method again next week on a larger study module, or add some review mechanism to myself, such as a quick summary of key words in the last five minutes, to see if I can further improve my memory.

Reflection
This little experiment made me realize that different learning styles do bring different results. Using a more scientific approach to testing learning efficiency, rather than guessing or relying on feelings, allows me to optimize my approach more precisely. Next, I want to use the strategy of "focus in segments + short breaks" when writing code or working on projects to see if I can reduce bugs more effectively and keep my mind clear. All in all, this is an interesting and beneficial experiment, and I believe it will help me better manage my time and attention in my subsequent study and actual work.
